#Project Explanation

# manager page
I am using redux with localstorage to mock the data and to retain it. Generating random ids in redux to store.

using "useState" to maintain the general state of the page

You can click the "ADD KEY" to add a new key.

You can click "edit this" to switch to edit view.

After all the edits click "SAVE" to save to the data. data will saved and retained in local storage so page refresh will not effect and data will persist.

# Request Page
As this was simple display I didnt use the local storage or redux but the Filter for "denied", "approved" and "pending" is working using "useState"
and clicking on fliters will update the data.
